I love to program, play basketball, and create. I like to draw, and work with procreate to create animations, logos, etc.
I am a senior student at Mission San Jose High school in Fremont, CA. My dream college is UC Berkeley. I am an software engineer intern 
at slingshotahead and have made multiple games, a pathfinding program, (pathfindr) and am working on my own app!
