I love to program, play basketball, and create. I like to draw, and work with procreate to create animations, logos, etc.
I am a senior student at Mission San Jose High school in Fremont, CA. I hope to study comptuter science at UC Santa Cruz. I am currently working on my own app, as well as focusing on ways to improve the community around me.
